# Architecture
src/
â”œâ”€ core/            # Core services and modules
â”œâ”€ features/        # Feature-specific modules and components
â”œâ”€ shared/          # Shared components, pipes, and utilities
â””â”€ app.module.ts    # Main module



# Benefits of This Architecture

âœ… **Modularity:** Clear separation between `core/`, `features/`, and `shared/` directories.  
âœ… **Standalone Components:** Enhances performance and simplifies imports.  
âœ… **State Management:** Utilizes NgRx to maintain state .  
âœ… **Service Best Practices:** The `cocktail.service.ts` encapsulates API calls effectively.  
âœ… **Accessibility & UX:** Leverages Angular Material for a polished user interface.  
âœ… **Testing:** Simplifies dependency injection and mocking with Jest.
